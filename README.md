# Symbiosis-Netlogo
This project explores the "Hold-Up Problem" in Industrial Symbiosis (IS) networks using an Agent-Based Model (ABM) built in NetLogo, accompanied by Python analysis scripts. The simulation investigates how Green Energy industrial networks survive under conditions of market turbulence, varying contract enforcement strength, and social learning.
