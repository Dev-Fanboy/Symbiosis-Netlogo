Strategic Behavior & Anomaly Detection in Multi-Agent Systems

Project: The "Hold-up" Problem in Industrial Symbiosis

Tech Stack: NetLogo (ABM), Python (Data Prep), Behavioral Simulation

🚀 Overview

This repository contains a computational simulation designed to investigate how institutional lock-in and sunk costs affect agent behavior in decentralized networks. While the model uses "Industrial Symbiosis" (waste heat exchange) as the primary case study, the underlying logic is a direct simulation of marketplace dynamics, pacing, and contract integrity.

Key Business Logic Explored:

The Hold-up Problem: How agents respond when they are "locked in" to a high-specificity relationship.

Pacing & Market Shocks: Monitoring how survival rates and transaction volumes fluctuate when external energy prices (market signals) shift rapidly.

Anomaly Detection: Identifying "opportunistic" agents—those who renegotiate or default on contracts based on short-term market volatility.

📊 Methodology & Large-Scale Experimentation

To ensure statistical significance, I leveraged automated parameter sweeps to stress-test the system resilience.

Total Iterations: 4,320 automated runs.

Method: Multi-agent simulation with heterogeneous behaviors (rational vs. opportunistic agents).

The "Valley of Death" Curve: Developed a performance visualization showing the critical threshold where entry barriers (sunk costs) lead to systemic network failure.

🛠 Repository Structure

industrial_symbiosis_v1.nlogo: The core simulation engine built in NetLogo.

data_analysis/: Python scripts used for post-simulation data scrubbing and trend visualization.

results/: Sample CSV outputs showing agent pacing under various market volatility scenarios.

💡 Key Findings

Reputation > Penalties: In high-volatility environments, reputation-based trust systems stabilized the network 25% better than static financial penalties.

Lock-in Sensitivity: Identified a non-linear "breaking point" where increased entry costs caused a total collapse in network liquidity, regardless of agent trust levels.

Note for Recruiters: This project demonstrates my ability to build complex simulations, monitor performance drivers in real-time, and translate abstract data into actionable strategic insights.
